    <h2>So much time, and so little to do...</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>These days it seems as though every editor has his or her own definitions of what goes into each stage of the editing process. And that makes sense. <strong>Every novel is unique</strong>, after all, and just as every writer has his or her own approach, so too does every editor.</p> 
        <p>Many people can work on a novel, but at the end of the day it has only one author: You. And that means that, ultimately, <strong>only you are responsible</strong> for the choices that shape the reality of your vision.</p>
        <p class="ta-center"><strong>Choose wisely.</strong></p>
        <p>Alternate Intro: As I'm sure no one needs to tell you, completing a novel can be a somewhat daunting process. At times it can seem that there are a million permutations of the editing process: Editorial Assessments, Developmental Edits, Beta Reading, Line Edits, Copy Edits, Proofreading...where does it all end? Add to all that the task of finding an editor who not only aligns with your writing style and understands the meaning of your work, but also <strong>fits your budget</strong>, and it can seem just about miraculous that anything at all gets published these days.</p>
        <p>But it isn't all doom and gloom. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, and that light has a name:</p>

<!-- Editorial Assessment -->

<section class="editorialAssessment">
    <h2>Editorial Assessment</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>This is the place to start if you've just finished your first draft and are thinking about the possibility of major changes to genre, perspective, plot, main characters, and/or themes. It's also a great place to start if this is your first novel and you're feeling a bit lost, as an assessment at this level can help you to get a solid grasp on exactly what your story is about.</p>
        <p>With an Editorial Assessment, you can expect to receive a <strong>three- to five-thousand-plus-word write-up</strong> examining the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Genre.</strong> While it's possible that you may want to make a sharp left turn to a completely different genre, it's more likely that you'll want to accentuate particular elements of your story and develop them into a clear sub-genre: Whether your story is Horror with comedic relief vs. a true Horror-Comedy can make all the difference in the world when it comes to fulfilling readers' expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Perspective.</strong> When Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the first draft of A Study in Scarlet, it was Watson alone who used his skills as an Army doctor to solve the mystery. But something didn't quite feel right; the reader, Doyle felt, had <em>too much</em> access to the mind of the protagonist, and he wanted that protagonist to be just as mysterious as the plot of the story itself. I'm sure I don't have to tell you how it all turned out.</li>
            <li><strong>Plot.</strong> This is sort of a tricky one. As an editor, I make it a point not to change anything fundamental about the story itself, and one of the quickest ways to alter the meaning and importance of a story is to alter the plot. That said, I'll be spending a lot of time examining what exactly your story is about, and I'll tell you what your story meant to me. Moreover, once I have a satisfactory handle on that, I'll be looking at how the sub-plots you've created serve to further and color that core narrative.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Characters.</strong> Your characters are the soul of your story, and as such they ought to be the ones that drive the plot and leave their marks on the world around them. The human mind is easily the most complex system in the universe, and so creating characters that are honest, deep, consistent (in their own way), and interesting is one of if not the absolute trickiest things to do, period. I can't promise anything concrete in terms of what you'll get back here except that I'll give it absolutely everything I've got.</li>
            <li><strong>Themes.</strong> While, depending on your philosophy of fiction, the meaning of a story might be the sole responsibility of the reader, as an author your use of theme is going to be one of the ways you can shall we say influence what the reader may or may not pick up on. As your editor I'll be focusing mainly on identifying what themes you've chosen and how best to utilize them to serve your story's characters, plot, and world.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's important to note that this is <em>not</em> going to be a detailed look at any particular chapters or sections of your novel. <strong>This is by design</strong>: At this point you're considering whether to cut or rewrite major components of your manuscript, and so focusing too much on any one element can make it even more difficult to make those rather intimidating decisions.</p>
        <p>But don't worry! <strong>An editorial assessment is only a starting point.</strong> If producing a novel is like folding an origami crane, then an editorial assessment is equivalent to making sure the corners and edges of your paper are as sharp and as true as possible.</p>
