                    It’s been said that you’ll never really know what your story is about until you’ve finished it. In my experience, a great story is never truly finished, but somewhere along the way a part of the veil lifts and you suddenly see a little more of its inner mechanisms: how characters shape and are shaped by the worlds around them, how the plot fits together to form a consistent whole, and how through analogy your story points to a deeper and more universal truth. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I can't lift that veil for you, just as I can't, and won't, write your story for you. What I <em>can</em> do is tell you what your story means to me and show you how to tell it as efficiently and effectively as possible. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When you're ready, send me the first thousand words of your novel, novella, or short story, and in a few days I’ll send back a free line or developmental edit. The proof is in the .pdf, as they say.
